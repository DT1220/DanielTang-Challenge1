# DanielTang-Challenge1
Completed this challenge by myself 

This project was to clean up code that is used to create a webpage. I was given an example of what the client wants the webpage to look like and it was my job to make the webpage look like the example and clean up the code. 


```
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
